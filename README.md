It would be useful if a first year computer scientist could rapidly prototype a circuit on an Altera DE2 FPGA board without using a hardware description language. The user interface might be presented as a graphical circuit entry system allowing the user to select components from a library (including, 2- and 3-input NOR and NAND gates, RS-latch and D flip-flop) and place them on the screen. Additional components like RAMs and ROMs would be desirable. Switches and LEDs that are present on the DE2 board should be present in the graphical environment to allow circuits to be interfaced to them. Saving and loading of circuits is desirable. Circuits created should be simulated on the DE2 board. The transfer of the circuit to the FPGA simulation might happen in real-time (i.e. any change in the circuit is reflected "instantly" in the simulation). The simulation might be performed in software by a soft processor on the FPGA. For a high performance implementation, the graphical circuit might also be written out as Verilog and then synthesised for direct implementation on the FPGA.
