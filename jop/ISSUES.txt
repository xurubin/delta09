1. maximum method size - which is important for JOPs method cache restrictions).

 With JOP you can (theoretically) access up to 16GB of memory
(2^32 * 4). However, the method struct has a little limitation:
constant pool and method start address use only 20 bits. That
means class information and bytecode has to be less than
4MB (2^20*4). If this is a limitation than the method struct has
to be changed (adding another word). The heap can still be up
to 16GB. ...Ok, there is another limitation: A method is not allowed to
be larger than the bytecode cache. (As the first one has suggested)
